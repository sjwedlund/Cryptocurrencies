# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this repository is create an analysis for my clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. I have created a report that includes what cryptocurrenciews are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. The data has been processed to fit the machine learning models using unsupervised machine learning. I used a clustering algorith to group the cryptocurrencies and data visualizations to share my findings with the board.
